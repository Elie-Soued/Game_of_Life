# ConwayÂ´s Game of Life

## Introduction

checkout the below wikipedia page :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

#### Game of life

was created in 1970 by the British matematician John Conway.
<br>
He divided a grid into cells.
<br>
Each cell had a state :
<br>
It could be dead or alive.
<br>
Black or white.
<br>
1 or 0.
<br>

In addition to having a state, cells had also 8 neigbors.
<br>
<br>

#### Rules of the Game

If a living cell has 2 or 3 living neighbors, it lives on to the next generation.
<br>
If a living cell has less than 2 living neighbors, it dies of underpopulation.
<br>
If a living cell has more than 3 living neigbors, it dies of overpopulation.
<br>
If a dead cell has exactly 3 living neigbors, it comes back to life.

## The Project Structure

---

The project is basically composed of 2 sections:

- Animation of the landing page.
- The Game of life algorithm

### I-Landing page Animation

1- Circle.js (Class)
<br>
2- constant.js
<br>
3- eventListener.js
<br>

### II-Game of Life Algorithm

1-Canvas.js (class)
<br>
2-Cell.js (class)
<br>
3-constants.js
<br>
4-eventListener.js
<br>
